# Brushstrokes_and_Backpropagation

### Dataset Download:
- The dataset used for this project isn't a conventional dataset. You'll need two sets of images: content images (the images to which you want to transfer style) and style images (the images from which the style is extracted). In my case, I used portrait images as content images and my landscape paintings as style images which you may download by cloning this repository, the images are stored in data folder.

### Environment Setup:
- Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. If not, download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org).
- Optionally, you can set up a Conda environment by installing Conda from the Anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
- Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new Python environment using the desired tool (e.g., conda create --name myenv or python -m venv myenv).
- Activate the newly created environment using the appropriate command (conda activate myenv or source myenv/bin/activate).
- Install the required libraries, packages, and modules by executing the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
